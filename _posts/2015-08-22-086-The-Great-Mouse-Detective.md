In this installment the Knights share the details their underwhelming week, and they really needed Gold Five to remind them to ["Stay on topic!"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/quotes?item=qt0440654) The flick pick for the week is Disney's [The Great Mouse Detective](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091149/), a childhood favorite of Ceebs, and one the Cat hasn't seen since the VHS era.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/midnight-movie-knights/) chat by [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@dianae173](https://twitter.com/dianae173), and [@bozobarr](https://twitter.com/bozobarr).
