In this installment the Knights prove that they truly are idiots with microphones, and a mixer capable of altering their voices. The tomfoolery continued as they arrived at their verbal joust, the Tournament of Segments, unarmed, and without their trusty steeds. The result is a couple ninnies slapping each other like the dimwits they are. This week’s Flick Pick is [Bram Stoker’s Dracula](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103874/) and Ceebs couldn’t even be bothered to finish it as she cites "time with family" as her excuse for not being prepared. Sir Kitteh valiantly stepped in and shared his thoughts as he scratched the flick off his "Watch Eventually" scroll.
