The Knights return with another not safe for work dose of verbal diarrhea in which they actually cover life, pop-culture, and movies. What can you expect from the babbling buddies?

* Kitteh and the bike accident, a tale of helpful people, especially bus drivers.
* Social Ceebs has headaches and is getting into meditation.
* [Suicide Squad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/) and [Yoga Hosers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3838992/) get some time in the spotlight.

The Flick Pick of the week is [Juno](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/). Cat has never seen it, while Ceebs loves it because, survey says, she finds the characters very relatable.

Stay tuned next week, same Knight time, same Knight channel. Go Team Knights! Someone can't stop saying Knight! "With a K!"
