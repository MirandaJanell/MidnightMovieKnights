The Knights are joined this week by a fellow movie junkie out there, [Tim](https://twitter.com/tim_slscast) from [The SLS Cast](http://slscast.podbean.com/). Cinderella, Southern California living, [Jim Parsons](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1433588/) in [Home](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2224026/), and water burgers are among the plethora of topics covered. This week's Flick Pick was [Horns](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528071/), and the concensus was not in favor of the flick. Both Knights and the cinematic wizard that one might call Tim felt nothing but contempt for the film that could have been oh so much more, and if possible all three would like a refund on the two hours of life lost while viewing. Ceebs and That Frakking Cat would like thank Tim for joining them as they truly had a blast ripping Horns a new one.
