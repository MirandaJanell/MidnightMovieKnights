In this installment the Knights try to explain away why episode 104 is missing, the short story is #BlameTom. The Cat shares experience riding his bike to and from work, and Ceebs just never shuts ups, like that's anything new. The Flick Pick for the week is Walk the Line, a suggestion from the Cat because he'd been listening to a lot of Johnny Cash lately.
