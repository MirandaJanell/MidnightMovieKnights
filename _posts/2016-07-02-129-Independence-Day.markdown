Tech issues throw Ceebs big time, but that doesn't stop the Knights returning for another installment of not safe for work verbal diarrhea that ends on a high note. Ceebs still doesn't enjoy Batman v Superman, while Kat wishes he had able to see it in the theater. The Flick Pick for this truncated episode is 1996's [Independence Day](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629).

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Revelstoke Jim (@RevelstokeJim)](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [Tom Kaytt (@tkaytt)](https://twitter.com/tkaytt), [Dianae Weeks (@dianae173)](https://twitter.com/dianae173), and [Ryan Connolly (@kaarval)](https://twitter.com/kaarval).
