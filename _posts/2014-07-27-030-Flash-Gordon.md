The Knights are joined once again joined by We Are Not Here To Please You (WANHTPY) podcast and the usual level of inappropriateness and bickering ensues. The Knights debut a new segment called "Pop My Culture Cherry" the new home of pop culture news on the show. This weeks Flick Pick is Flash Gordon, which Ceebs hasn't seen yet and The Cat and Rafael mock her appropriately. Ceebs blackmails Rafael in what Rafael inappropriately calls the longest stinger ever. Duh everyone who listens to us probably already knows that the Longest Stinger Ever award belongs to NetHeads.
