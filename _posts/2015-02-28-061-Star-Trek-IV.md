No tournament, no direction, just the Knights talking, while watching, live, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Just kicking it on the couch this week, the Knights go for something a little different. Ceebs has had a busy week and the Cat has been feeling poorly so the Knights decided to sit back relax and just catch up. It was a fun idea that we'd do again sometime, if you agree, or even if you disagree, send us a tweet @MovieKnightsPod or drop us an email at contact@midnightmovieknights.com
