The week has worn out Ceebs, so the Cat takes the Captain's chair and he talks about reminiscing with family on Father's Day, agreeing with Walt Flanagan, invasions of his purrsonal space and trying out maple bacon popcorn to honor the Knights' Canadian friends all while Ceebs puts up with it. Skype attacks the Knights but they prevail the onslaught then watch The Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly flick Step Brothers.
