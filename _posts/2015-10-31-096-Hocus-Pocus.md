In this Halloween episode, the Knights prove that they truly are idiots with microphones. This one is chalk full of bickering, reminiscing about movies that came out in 1996, and, of course, the signature feature of the show, tangents while talking about the Flick Pick. This weeks Flick Pick was Ceebs' favorite Halloween movie, [Hocus Pocus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107120/), which the Cat hadn't seen before.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@markoshark](https://twitter.com/markoshark), [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@RevelstokeJim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [@madzub](https://twitter.com/madzub), and [@Dianae173](https://twitter.com/Dianae173).
