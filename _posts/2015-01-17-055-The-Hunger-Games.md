The Knights get off to a slow start, but they eventually got it on track. Ceebs crushes The Kitteh in the Tournament of Segments and this little blurb is her bragging rights. The Flick Pick for this week is [The Hunger Games](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/), and at show time the Knights had only watched an hour of it. The stinger turned out to be a real stinker as Ceebs tells the tale of the 2:30 AM fountain farter.
