Holy tangent Batman! The Knights tried to talk about their experience seeing their Flick Pick Raiders of the Lost Ark at Irvine Meadows with Pacific Symphony playing the score live, but instead they launched off into a massive tangent that started with Kitteh being pissed at not being able to find out information about Jaws on the beach. Ceebs enjoyed the bad parenting a bit too much while Kat had a very unmotivated day, but then there's the tubes, oh the tubes.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Revelstoke Jim (@RevelstokeJim)](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [CaperGirlMel (@CaperGirlMel)](https://twitter.com/CaperGirlMel), [Dianae (@Dianae173)](https://twitter.com/Dianae173), [Marc Thorner (@markoshark)](https://twitter.com/markoshark), and [Marianne (@mv_ughn)](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn).
