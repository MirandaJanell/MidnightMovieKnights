Miranda describes how jury duty led to a new site for the podcast. The knights discus Tusk, @JudgeFunkyBoy’s new podcast, Wresting Podcast Federation, and spend some time discussing an awesome entertainer that we lost during the week, Harold Ramis. The flick pick for the week, in memory of Harold Ramis, is Ghostbusters. The Knights really earn the explicit tag in the post movie watching conversation, and if you don’t know what’s going on towards the end, tweet us and we’ll explain it.
