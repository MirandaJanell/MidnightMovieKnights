The Tournament of Segments returns this week and it's [That Frakking Cat](https://twitter.com/ThatFrakkingCat) that gets the bragging rights. [Operation New Litterbox](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OperationNewLitterBox) has already provided Kitteh with a new source of stories. And the Knights discuss their Flick Pick [Big Hero 6](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245084/), which just so happens to be the first movie they've seen in the theaters together!
