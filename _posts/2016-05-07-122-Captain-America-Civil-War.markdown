In this installment the Knights start silly, and then follow a tangent and briefly discuss the tragic fire up north in Fort McMurray. Incapable of being serious for too long, the Knights dive into topics such as Free Comic Book Day, LEGO Dimensions, plans to harness Ceebs' allergies as a renewable energy source and Kitteh's coronation. The Flick Pick for the week is [Captain America: Civil War](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/) which the Knights saw just 8 hours prior to the start of the show, and they totally didn't hate it.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Revelstoke Jim (@RevelstokeJim)](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [Ryan Connolly (@kaarval)](https://twitter.com/kaarval), [Dianae (@Dianae173)](https://twitter.com/Dianae173), and [Marianne (@mv_ughn)](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn).
