This week the Knights are on a mission to pod. The live show was delayed slightly due to a desire for sustinance and genuine human interaction with friends. Ceebs talks a bit about [Inside Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/) while Cat tells a tale about morons. The Knights didn't have a Flick Pick prepared, which led Ceebs to demonstrate how she likes playing with numbers, but also how bad her memory is as she forgets that they've already done [Star Wars](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/). The Knights kinda revist Star Wars, kinda talk about [Jaws](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/), and talk a bit about [Kung Fury](https://youtu.be/bS5P_LAqiVg), but mostly it's just Ceebs showing what a terrible person she truly is. Stay tuned in the stinger for a brief discussion of [Captain Honkass](https://twitter.com/CaptainHonkass)'s review of [Bloodsport](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092675/) as clipped with permission from [How Not to Make a Movie](https://twitter.com/NotMovie).
