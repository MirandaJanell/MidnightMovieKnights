The knights storm the interwebs with another installment of their goofy take on what a movie podcast ought to be. The knights valiantly battled each other in the Tournament of Segments only to determine that this weeks match was a draw. The Flick Pick for the week is [Contact](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/){:target="_blank" title="Contact"}, and in typical Midnight Movie Knights fashion, the knights got distracted and talked about other tangential topics.
