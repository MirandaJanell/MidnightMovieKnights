Ceebs literally runs away and abandons the Kitteh to his own wits to carry the show. Both Knights fail to appreciate the holiday spirit, but according to the Cat, their Flick Pick [Scrooged](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096061/) will make it all better. Also in this installment, Ceebs has ideas for Boxing Day games at the Empire.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Tom Sherlock (@judgefunkyboy)](https://twitter.com/judgefunkyboy), [Tom Kaytt (@tkaytt)](https://twitter.com/tkaytt), [Ryan Connolly (@Kaarval)](https://twitter.com/Kaarval), [Marianne (@mv_ughn)](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), and [Dale Hu (@madzub)](https://twitter.com/madzub).
