In this installment, the Knights return to their regular format. Ceebs goes, as That Frakking Cat would say, #FullCeebs (seriously, he uses a hashtag, in conversation, it's weird), and she ended up with the bragging rights in the Tournament of Segments. After the theatrical release of [The Interview](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788710/) was halted in response to threats of violence at theaters, the Knights jump on the [Team America: World Police](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/) bandwagon and choose it as their Flick Pick.
