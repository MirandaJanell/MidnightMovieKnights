The Knights return for another for another round of finding talking to be hard. The Cat is in pain, but he had a mostly good week. Ceebs not so much. After their last Flick Pick of [Independence Day](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/) the Knights saw [Independence Day: Ressurgence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1628841/) and they share their thoughts. This weeks' Flick Pick is [Super Mario Brothers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108255/) which both Knights admit isn't a great movie, but they love it anyway.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Revelstoke Jim (@RevelstokeJim)](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [Papa Mayor (@MayorOfBeertown)](https://twitter.com/MayorOfBeertown), [Marc Thorner (@markoshark)](https://twitter.com/markoshark), and [Dianae Weeks (@dianae173)](https://twitter.com/dianae173).
