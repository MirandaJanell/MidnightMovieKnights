The Knights retire #HashtagMorons as it has now graduated. A new segment, Science Flicktion was added and both Knights chose 80's classics. [@DCKantel](https://twitter.com/DCKantel) did two excellent show openers for us and Ceebs surprised The Cat with them. The Flick Pick for this week is a actually a Flik pick. We wanted to watch and animated film, and we both had [A Bug's Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120623) on the mind.
