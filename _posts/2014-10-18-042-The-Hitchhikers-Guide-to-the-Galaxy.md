The Knights watched The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy this week in honor of episode 42 and again they discussed the movie. The Cat was overly caffeinated again with these doubleshot espressos and his mind was all over the place. Ceebs tried to control him as best she could to keep on track, despite the return of SmittenKitten, but it won her the Tournament of Segments. Go Ceebs!
