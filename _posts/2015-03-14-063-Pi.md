To celebrate Pi day, the Knights have left Avalon and embarked on a sacred quest to meet up with another Knight at a castle in a foreign land. The foreign land is Las Vegas, the Castle is Excalibur, no not the sword, the castle, and the Knight is known to many as [Revelstoke Jim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim)! The Knights three discussed their travels, the peasants of this strange land, and the jesters at Laugh Factory. The head jester, [Steve 'Mudflap' McGrew](https://twitter.com/SteveMcGrew) was a gracious entertainer and the Knights three raise their glasses of mead to honor him. This weeks Flick Pick is the 1998 [Darren Aronofsky](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004716/) movie, [Pi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704/) about a paranoid mathematician who is searching for patterns in nature. Road pod rocks. We're having a blast, despite Ceebs and Jim getting [#WaffleBlocked](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23WaffleBlocked) at Johnny Rockets as events unfolded in a very Falling Down like manner.
