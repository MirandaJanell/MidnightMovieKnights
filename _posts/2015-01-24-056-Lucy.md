This week the Knights did battle with a foe they could not see, the ghastly common cold microbes. Ceebs was the first to fall, and Sir Kitteh had planned on valiantly taking the lead, but the microscopic invaders gained a foothold. After a trip to her parents castle, Ceebs was once again granted command over her voice, however temporariliy, thanks to a miracle potion and the show carried on. The Flick Pick for the week is [Lucy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/), a film full of bad science, but good sci-fi. The microbe invaders may have won this battle, but they will not win the war as the Knights will return next week in healthier form.
