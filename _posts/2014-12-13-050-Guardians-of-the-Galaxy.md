The Knights have made it to their 50th episode. Since 50 is one of those special numbers, they decided they needed a special Flick Pick. Fate intervened when [Guardians of the Galaxy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/) was released on Blu-ray/DVD earlier in the week. The Knights were honored to be joined by their friends [Jim Browning](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [Marc Thorner](https://twitter.com/MarkoShark), and [Patrick Blazek](https://twitter.com/tessek1138) not only on the show, but in watching the movie together as well. One member of the group had not seen the flick yet and both Knights truly enjoyed seeing their friends face light up with joy while watching. The Tournament of Segments was skipped this week, but like James Bond, it will return in Episode 51.
