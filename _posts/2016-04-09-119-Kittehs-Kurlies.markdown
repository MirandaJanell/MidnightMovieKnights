In this installment, Kitteh gets a haircut followed by getting more agitated and paranoid while Ceebs encourages him to smoke pot to take the edge off. The Knights thank [Neil](https://twitter.com/angelsfreak7) and [Annaleis](https://twitter.com/wiretechgirl) from [Dark Angels and Pretty Freaks](https://twitter.com/dapfpodcast), profusely. Seriously, it was almost to excess, and by the end of the show, the chatters were even having fun with it. Multiple flicks were mentioned, but the Knights never landed on a Flick Pick so they talked about the packaging of their new Star War: The Force Awakens Blu-rays.
For the record the Knights would like to take one more opportunity to thank [Neil](https://twitter.com/angelsfreak7) and [Annaleis](https://twitter.com/wiretechgirl) from [Dark Angels and Pretty Freaks](https://twitter.com/dapfpodcast) for joining them the previous week.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Marc Thoner (@markoshark)](https://twitter.com/markoshark), [Dale Hu (@madzub)](https://twitter.com/madzub), [Ryan Connolly (@kaarval)](https://twitter.com/kaarval), [Comic Newb (@ComicNewb)](https://twitter.com/ComicNewb), [Revelstoke Jim (@RevelstokeJim)](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [Tom Sherlock (@judgefunkyboy)](https://twitter.com/judgefunkyboy), [Matt Quinton (@nittwit12345)](https://twitter.com/nittwit12345), [Marianne (@mv_ughn)](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), and [gedidan fm](http://mixlr.com/gedidan-fm/).
