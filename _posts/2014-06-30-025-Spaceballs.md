Ceebs is back in town, barely, and pretty much only talks about her trip. The Cat is up to his regular hijinks but is starting to show some ageism. Both Knights slam the new Ninja Turdles trailer. The Flick Pick for the week was Magic Mike until The Knights realized it was episode 25 and decided they wanted to watch something special. They totally didn't plan that either. Seriously, would they lie to you?
