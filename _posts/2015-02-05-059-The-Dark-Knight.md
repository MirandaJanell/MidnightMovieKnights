On a very special episode, special just being live on Sunday instead of Saturday night, the Knights are joined by [Jim Browning](https://twitter.com/revelstokejim) and [Marc Thorner](https://twitter.com/markoshark). Battling through the tournament with Jim, the Knights welcome Marc Thorner to discuss, yes actually discuss, with tangents thrown in of course, this week's Flick Pick, [The Dark Knight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/). While everyone agrees that they enjoy the movie, there are some issues they had to mention. Thanks to Jim Browning and Marc Thorner for joining us this week, it was fun guys.
