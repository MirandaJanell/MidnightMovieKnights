The battle against illness has been conquered, mostly, and the battle hardened Knights have returned. Realizing an oversight, the Knights discuss the one year anniversary of when they posted their first show for all to hear. A lot has happened in the span of a year and the Knights are pleased. A story makes the Kitteh realize he has never had to search for what most men seem to be googling the most. The tournament returns with the Kitteh emerging triumphant for a change. Ceebs laments over a once brown sky as the Knights discuss this week's Flick Pick, [Falling Down](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856/). Everything's coming up Kitteh in this episode as he wins the show and the hat trick.

Special note from the Kitteh: â€œApologies in advance."
