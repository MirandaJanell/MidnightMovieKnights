This week The Knights are joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/nittwit12345" target="_blank">Matt</a> from <a href="http://theslscast.com/">The SLS Cast</a>. Matt cleans up in the Tournament of Segments, Ceebs loses her ability to translate thoughts into words, and The Cat? He's The Cat, duh. The Flick Pick for this week is The Right Stuff. Both Knights and their guest have seen the movie multiple times, although The Cat doesn't think he's seen it all the way through in one sitting.
