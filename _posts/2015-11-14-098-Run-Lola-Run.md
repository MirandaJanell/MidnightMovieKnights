The Pizza Knights return for another go at a weekly dose of verbal diarrhea about life, pop culture, and most importantly **PIZZA!!!** While discussing the pizza situation, the Cat feels the need to remind Ceebs that she's a [#CAdbag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CADbag). The Cat also shared why he was [#OutragedKitteh](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OutragedKitteh), and Ceebs really isn't a fan of Lady Millenial Pizza Face. The Knights did another bracket showdown to chose their Flick Pick, and once the Cat learned of the timey wimey nature of [Run Lola Run](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/), it sprinted ahead and no other flick could catch up.  

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@markoshark](https://twitter.com/markoshark), [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@RevelstokeJim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [@ComicNewb](https://twitter.com/ComicNewb), [@madzub](https://twitter.com/madzub), [@Dianae173](https://twitter.com/Dianae173) and [Carbono](http://mixlr.com/carbono).
