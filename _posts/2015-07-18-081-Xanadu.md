The Knights start off with some audio difficulties but move forward, slaying the audio beast that threatens them. They also discuss the heat and how water from the sky is a very, very good thing, mostly. It's possibly the last show in the Knight's castle as they prepare to move to a new kingdom! Ceebs has a revelation at the last minute that saves them both from a potential disaster. The Ceebs knight is clearly the hero this week since the Cat has been clueless. Nice, Kitteh, nice. Thanks go out to [Johnny Whitetrash](http://johnnywhitetrash.com/) for sponsoring this week's show. Johnny voted for our Flick Pick to be the 1980 [Olivia Newton-John musical](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000556/), [Xanadu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081777/)! Roller skates, [Gene Kelly](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000037/), musical genres colliding and [Don Bluth](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089940/) animation all rolled into one 80s package with neon! Neither Knight hated the flick but understand it is an enjoyable movie for what it was.
