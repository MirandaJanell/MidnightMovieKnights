This week, the Knights refuse to start the show description with "In this installment...", "This week...", "The Knights....", or any of their other common introductory phrases. What do you mean we already screwed that up? Oh bother. In the life portion of the show, the Knights share another bike story, the Cat has the sick, and Ceebs has been weepy over the passing of [Alan Rickman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000614/). While discussing DVD rewind fees, [@ComicNewb](https://twitter.com/ComicNewb) called to share a real life experience, and he didn't even let anyone know it was his birthday. Frequent collaborator [@RevelstokeJim](https://twitter.com/revelstokejim) phoned in as well to check up on and hang out with the bickering buddies. In honor of Alan Rickman, this week's Flick Pick is [Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102798/). Check back soon to pre-order the Knights latest product, the Genuine DVD / Blu-ray Rewinder. Act fast, the first 1000 pre-orders come with the bonus LaserDisc and MiniDisc adapters, a $39.99 value at absolutely no additional cost to you, just pay separate processing and handling.
