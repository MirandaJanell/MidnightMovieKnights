The Knights start late again, because, well, you know, sleepy Kitteh. Ceebs calls a Flick Pick audible in the middle of the Tournament of Segments and conviced The Cat that they should watch [Legally Blonde](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250494/). The Cat had never seen it before, and Ceebs decided he needed to be educated in the ways of the bend and snap. That wasn't even the first time the Flick Pick changed. The original flick pick was [Hesher](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403177/), but since the Knights didn't watch it before the show they chose [Employee of the Month](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424993/) instead. Seriously Knights, just pick a flick and stick with it, right?
