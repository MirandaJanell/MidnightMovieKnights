Kitteh gets back in touch with his artistic side and pushes Ceebs' buttons. Ceebs shares a couple stories about how she stepped out of her comfort zone and gets shut down, got emo about the Olympics, and freaked out at the movie theater. The Flick Pick of the week is Suicide Squad and both Knights agree that they didn't hate it, but they didn't didn't hate it as well. Happy Birthday Ryan!

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Revelstoke Jim (@RevelstokeJim)](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [Qassem166](http://mixlr.com/qassem166/), [Matt Quinton (@nittwit12345)](https://twitter.com/nittwit12345), [Marc Thorner (@markoshark)](https://twitter.com/markoshark), and [Marianne (@mv_ughn)](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn).
