In this installment the Knights experimented with their start time and go on 3 hours earlier than normal. For episode 94, the Knights stuck with their established pattern and focused on 1994. After mentioning a bunch of movies that aren't their Flick Pick, the Knights finally settled down and talked about a bunch of other stuff that isn't True Lies in between their attempts at discussing the flick.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@markoshark](https://twitter.com/markoshark), [@RevelstokeJim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [@dckantel](https://twitter.com/dckantel), [@MayorOfBeerTown](https://twitter.com/MayorOfBeerTown), [@madzub](https://twitter.com/madzub), and [@revoltingnow](https://twitter.com/revoltingnow).

Hey Ceebs, why do you put in peoples twitter profiles when they join you on the Mixlr chat? You know they have Mixlr profiles don't you? Silly Ceebs.
