Ceebs had the opportunity to watch Star Trek: Into Darkness this evening at The Christ Cathedral in Garden Grove, CA, which is where the Starfleet Headquarters scenes were filmed. She was so overwhelmed with emotion that she just had to make sweet sweet pod with The Cat. The Knights jumped on the stream for an impromptu show to discuss the experience.
