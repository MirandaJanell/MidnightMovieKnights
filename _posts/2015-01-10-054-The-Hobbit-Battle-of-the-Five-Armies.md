A few hours before the show, The Knights changed their Flick Pick for the week and went to a local theater and saw [The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2310332/), which ended up being That Frakking Cat's first 3D theatrical experience. They had some concerns over the Tournament of Segments, so it was skipped this week in favor of talking about the Flick Pick in much greater than normal depth. There was a ton of noise coming from Angel Stadium because the monster trucks were over there having their Monster Jam. Sir Kitteh had a nice momentary scare when the fireworks started going off and he realized just how close the exploding balls of pretty colored firey goodness actually are.
