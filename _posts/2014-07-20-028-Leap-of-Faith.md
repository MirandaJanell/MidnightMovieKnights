The Knights have another goofy night of chit chat. At one point Ceebs even left the show for a few minutes to watch the fireworks that just moments before had scared the crap out of her. Stunned by the sudden departure of his co-host, The Cat valiantly battled the silence monster. Upon Ceebs' return, she dicovered that The Cat had emerged victorious, and the show could go on. This weeks Flick Pick is Leap of Faith starring Steve Martin. Ceebs has never seen it, and The Cat is eager share this flick because it's one of his favorites.
