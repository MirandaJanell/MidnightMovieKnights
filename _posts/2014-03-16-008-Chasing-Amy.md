In this installment, the Knights get a little goofy. Miranda gets distracted as usual, she hates another store, and then there's that thing at the end. The Cat tells us more stories about crazy people at a certain big box retailer. Captain America, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, Veronica Mars and this week's flick pick, Chasing Amy, all get some air time. Hashtag morons.
