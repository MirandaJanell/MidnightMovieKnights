In this installment, Miranda has a fangasm over the Star Wars news that just broke, but one Knight in particular wins the show by default. That Frakking Cat spins a yarn and tells a tale, he just might have to get a hat as well. This weeks #FlickPick is The Truman Show, and it's a symbolic pick for The Cat.
