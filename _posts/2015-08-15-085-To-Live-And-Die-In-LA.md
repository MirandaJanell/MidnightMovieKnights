The Knights have gathered once again to share tales of gatherings and artistic endeavors. The Cat mentions a mostly uneventful week, but does describe his latest illustrations. Meanwhile near the Knights former castle, Ceebs celebrates being a self proclaimed "Disney Dork" by meeting people of notoriety such as [Rob Paulsen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/) and [Cindy Morgan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604563/), finding Ewok related items, and having her personal space invaded by a creeper. Ceebs took on D23 and loved every second of it! Well, except for the creeper, Ceebs doesn't like creepers. She's weird, but not that weird. The Flick Pick this week is [To Live and Die in L.A.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090180/), a favorite of the Cat which he's seen many times. Ceebs, not so much, this was her first viewing and she wasn't a big fan, but she still gave it the "Didn't Hate It!" seal of approval.  

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/midnight-movie-knights/) chat by [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@revelstokejim](https://twitter.com/revelstokejim), [@AvailableInADHD](https://twitter.com/AvailableInADHD), [@dianae173](https://twitter.com/dianae173), and [@bozobarr](https://twitter.com/bozobarr).
