In this installment, Ceebs tells the tale of what you get when you have dark chocolate, wine, Nerf guns, [Spectre](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379713/), and a fire hydrant within about 24 hours. The Knights run down 44 possible Flick Pick candidates before choosing [Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/). The Cat tries to nerdshame Ceebs, and it backfires on him. Fear not for our noble feline, he did walk away with his head held high as he coined #NoAirBiscuits in the last moments of the show.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@JudgeFunkyBoy](https://twitter.com/JudgeFunkyBoy), [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@RevelstokeJim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [@ComicNewb](https://twitter.com/ComicNewb), [@madzub](https://twitter.com/madzub), and [@Dianae173](https://twitter.com/Dianae173).
