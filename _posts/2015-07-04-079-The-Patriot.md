This week the Knights jump right into the thick of things as Ceebs encourages the Kitteh to show his microphone a little love. At the time of recording the Knights hadn't finished watching their Flick Pick, [The Patriot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187393/). Ceebs gets confused by a French guy that she thought normally plays Russian guys, and yeah, she just got everything wrong. The show was shorter than normal as it was Independence Day in the United States and the Knights wanted to watch the fireworks.
