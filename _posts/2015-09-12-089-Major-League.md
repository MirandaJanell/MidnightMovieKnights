This installment was threatened by a recording glitch, but with some recording redundancy, a little editing and post processing, voila, a tale of two Knights at the ballpark. The Knights recount the events of the evening at the Angels game with [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn). The Flick Pick for the week is [Major League](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097815/), which both Knights agree was the perfect fit for the evening.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@revelstokejim](https://twitter.com/revelstokejim), and [@dianae173](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn).
