The Knights saddle up for episode 40, which unintentionally was scehduled on the fourth day of the tenth month. Ceebs attends a wedding and gets girly, again. Meanwhile in Kittehland, The Cat updates the litter box. Ceebs wins the Tournament of Segments, but fails with the Flick Pick, Midnight Run, since she's never seen it. Oh and The Cat fell for it again. What an idiot, with a microphone.
