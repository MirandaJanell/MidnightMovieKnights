Ceebs calls an audible and the Knights start the show with their FlickPick, [What About Bob?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/) The Knights discuss [Mission Hard Root Beer](http://missionbrewery.com/beer-styles/), and both Knights agree that it tastes great at first, but finishes way too strong. The Cat shares a tale of biggoted simians as a lead in to Ceebs sharing the details of an incident that occurred at work that shook her to her core. In telling her story, Ceebs bore all and got very emotional.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@RevelstokeJim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), and [@dianae173](https://twitter.com/dianae173).
