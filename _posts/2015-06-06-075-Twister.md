This week the Knights return and actually talk about movies, again. Seriously folks, this is weird, the Knights are starting on time, and they're talking about their Flick Picks. What is up with the world? The Kitteh tells the tale of his reactions to [San Andreas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2126355/), while Ceebs deals poor life choices leading to her ears ringing so loud it made her jump and reinjure her neck. Stupid farging %@#$*&^ tinnitus. This week's Flick Pick is [Twister](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117998/), a favorite of both Knights.
