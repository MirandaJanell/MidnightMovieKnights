In this installment, the Knights are joined by [Neil](https://twitter.com/angelsfreak7) and [Annaleis](https://twitter.com/wiretechgirl) of [Dark Angels and Pretty Freaks](https://twitter.com/dapfpodcast). If it's not clear by the amount of gushing at their guests, the Knights really love their podcast and had a ton of fun recording with part of their [#PodernFamily](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PodernFamily). This episode is full of stories, and lots of laughs, and plenty of the previously mentioned gushing. The Flick Pick for the week is [Broken Lizzard](http://www.brokenlizard.com)'s [Super Troopers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/), a favorite of Ceebs and Neil, but only seen once or twice by Kitteh and Annaleis.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [Dianae (@Dianae173)](https://twitter.com/Dianae173), [Ryan Connolly (@kaarval)](https://twitter.com/kaarval), [Comic Newb (@ComicNewb)](https://twitter.com/ComicNewb), [Mayor of Beertown (@MayorOfBeertown)](https://twitter.com/MayorOfBeertown), [Tom Kaytt (@tkaytt)](https://twitter.com/tkaytt), [Matt Quinton (@nittwit12345)](https://twitter.com/nittwit12345), and [Marianne (@mv_ughn)](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn).
