In this installment the Knights are joined by [Revelstoke Jim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim). Kitteh is tired of things blowing up in his face, and Ceebs can't remember crap, like that's anything new. The Flick Pick was The Departed, which the mere suggestion of invoked some explicit enthusiam.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [The Mayor of Beertown (@MayorOfBeertown)](https://twitter.com/MayorOfBeertown), [Comic Newb (@ComicNewb)](https://twitter.com/ComicNewb), [Marianne (@mv_ughn)](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [Marc Thorner (@markoshark)](https://twitter.com/markoshark), and [Tom Kaytt (@tomkaytt)](https://twitter.com/tomkaytt).
