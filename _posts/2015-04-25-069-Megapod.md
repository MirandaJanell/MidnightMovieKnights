Joined by [Johnny](https://twitter.com/TeamWhiteTrash) and [Huney](https://twitter.com/OMGWTFHuney) Whitetrash, [Revelstoke Jim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim) and his [Canadian Content](http://gabnet.net), [Matt](https://twitter.com/nittwit12345) from [SLS Cast](http://slscast.podbean.com), [Rafael](https://twitter.com/WANHTPY) of [We Are Not Here To Please You](http://wearenotheretopleaseyou.blogspot.fi), and [Will Wilkins](https://twitter.com/netheadww) of [NetHeads](http://smodcast.com/channels/netheads/), the Knights embark on their zaniest audio adventure yet, and they call it Megapod \*bum bum bum bum buuummmmmmmmmmmm\*. Ceebs is describing it as something that started as a simple crossover epsiode and turned into one of the weirdest nights of her life. Meanwhile the Cat is standing on a stage clasping a little golden statue in his paws and exclaiming, "for all of you to come together at the last minute to pull this off, I canâ€™t deny the fact that you like us, right now, you like us!" If Planters ever builds a museum, we have some serious candidates for the peanut gallery.

If you already listened to [The Johnny Whitetrash Show #69](http://johnnywhitetrash.com/the-johnny-whitetrash-show-no-69-the-kris-krossed-with-a-k-megapod/), this is almost exactly the same content.
