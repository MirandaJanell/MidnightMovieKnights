Joined by Johnny and Huney Whitetrash, Revelstoke Jim and his Canadian Content, Matt from SLS Cast, Raphael of We Are Not Here To Please You, and Will Wilkins of NetHeads, the Knights embark on their zaniest audio adventure yet, and they call it Megapod \*bum bum bum bum buuummmmmmmmmmmm\*. Ceebs is describing it as something that started as a simple crossover epsiode and turned into one of the weirdest nights of her life. Meanwhile the Cat is standing on a stage clasping a little golden statue in his paws and exclaiming, "for all of you to come together at the last minute to pull this off, I canâ€™t deny the fact that you like us, right now, you like us!" If Planters ever builds a museum, we have some serious candidates for the peanut gallery.

If you already listened to The Johnny Whitetrash show #69, this is almost exactly the same content, except for a little bit in the middle, and at the end.
