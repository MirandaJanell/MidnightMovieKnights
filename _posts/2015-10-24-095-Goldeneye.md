False starts due to upgrade woes put Ceebs in a frantic state, while the Cat is, as he puts it, old and grumpy. The Knights discuss a variety of topics including the new Star Wars trailer, Back to the Future Day, and movies released in 1995, including their Flick Pick, [Goldeneye](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113189/).

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@markoshark](https://twitter.com/markoshark), [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@RLE116](https://twitter.com/RLE116), [@MayorOfBeerTown](https://twitter.com/MayorOfBeerTown), [@Dianae173](https://twitter.com/Dianae173), [@revoltingnow](https://twitter.com/revoltingnow), [@AricDante](https://twitter.com/AricDante), and [@nittwit12345](https://twitter.com/nittwit12345).
