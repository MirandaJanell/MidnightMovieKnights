This week Ceebs tries to trigger paranoia in the Cat as part of her comedic master plan, and fails miserably. 3 days in the making and it failed #KittehWins. The Knights talk about the Cat being the new cohost of [We Are Not Here to Please You](http://wearenotheretopleaseyou.blogspot.fi), as well as Ceebs' career choices. The Flick Pick is [Dick Tracy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099422/) which is loved by both Knights. Err... Umm... we mean we didn't hate it.

The Knights were joined in the [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/{{ site.mixlrstub }}/) chat by [@WANHTPY](https://twitter.com/WANHTPY), [@RevelstokeJim](https://twitter.com/RevelstokeJim), [@mv_ughn](https://twitter.com/mv_ughn), [@kaarval](https://twitter.com/kaarval), [@RLE116](https://twitter.com/RLE116), and the honorable [@MayorOfBeertown](https://twitter.com/MayorOfBeertown).
