The knights discuss their journey to Death Ray Comics in Logan, UT. They also discuss Ceebs' new show, Getting Geeky with @MirandaJanell, on gabroadcaster.com. The flick pick is Jay and Silent Bob's Super Groovy Cartoon Movie, and neither of the knights have seen it yet. Well now they have, at the time of writing, but not at the time of making sweet sweet pod to each other.
