The Knights strike back with over 100 minutes of verbal diarrhea as Kitteh brings it and Ceebs falls down an [IMDB](http://imdb.com) rathole that informs just about everyone of the segments in the Tournament of Segments. The Knights were locked in battle for a record 13 segments, with Ceebs narrowly edging out Kitteh 11 to 10. The [#FlickPick](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlickPick) for the week was unknown until just hours before the show because the Knights left it up to the audience with a ["Pick Our Flick" strawpoll](http://strawpoll.me/2834924/r). The choices were [Meet the Parents](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212338/), [Analyze This](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122933/), and [The Untouchables](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094226/). The ultimate victor was [The Untouchables](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094226/), a movie that both Knights love. In the last minutes of the show, [@ThatFrakkingCat](https://twitter.com/ThatFrakkingCat) wasn't the only one that needed to hit the litterbox, Skype joined him and we were all reminded why [@MirandaJanell](https://twitter.com/MirandaJanell) is called Ceebs. 

The Knights will return next Saturday, November 1, 2014 with A Knights Tale. There couldn't be a more fitting [#FlickPick](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlickPick) as the Knights will changing their stars with [#OperationNewLitterBox](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OperationNewLitterBox).
