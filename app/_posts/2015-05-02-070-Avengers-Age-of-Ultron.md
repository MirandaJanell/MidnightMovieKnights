The Knights return from viewing one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015, Marvel's [Avengers: Age of Ultron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/)! Ye be warned matey, spoilers are dropped, but they kept some of really good stuff out of the conversation. The Knights are thoughtful that way, mostly. Ceebs had a moment with Captain America, and really loved the introduction of the Scarlett Witch. Kitteh went gaga over the Easter eggs providing some foreshadowing for the future movies. Both Knights agree on the official rating of didn't hate it, and will very likely see it again on the big screen.
