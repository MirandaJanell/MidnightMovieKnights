The Knights get a little nostalgic while The Cat listens to 80's dance music, and Ceebs starts watching Batman: The Animated Series. The Cat reveals how he turned into a smitten kiten and became our #HashtagMoron of the week. The Knights come down with a case of foot in mouth disease a couple times. And the nostalgia continues with this weeks Flick Pick of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.
