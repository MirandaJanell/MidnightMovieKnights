The Cat "ain't mad" and Miranda proves talking is hard. Actually, writing seems to be hard too. Miranda derped so hard during the show that she can't even write a proper description for the show. This week's bracket showdown ended up being a battle of the chick flicks. It's a [vampire](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000295/) and a [guy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131/) who will "[Say Anything](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258/)" against the timey wimey tale of [Sabertooth](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000630/) setting up his ex-girlfriend [Sally](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000212/) with his great-great grandfather [Wolverine](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413168/). This week's flick pick was the incestuous time traveling tale of [Kate and Leopold](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035423/).
