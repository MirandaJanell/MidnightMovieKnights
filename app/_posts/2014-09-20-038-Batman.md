The Knights had a new challenge in this episode as That Frakking Cat found himself without his voice. But fear not dear listener as the voice of That Frakking Cat was provided by his squire [Johhny Whitetrash](http://www.johnnywhitetrash.com). After giving her thoughts more time gel and become more apparent, Ceebs decides to go a bit further into depth on her thoughts about [Kevin Smith](https://www.twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith)'s [Tusk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3099498). The Flick Pick for this week is [Tim Burton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318)'s [Batman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895), and both Knights and Johnny the Whitetrash squire love this flick!

![Ceebs mentioned her stuffed animals, Bunny and Littlefoot, that she has had since 1988.](http://media.midnightmovieknights.com/img/MMK38BunnyAndLittlefoot-384x512.jpg)
