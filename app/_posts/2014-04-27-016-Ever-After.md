The knights certainly prove that they are idiots with microphones as Ceebs tries to work Kitteh up to an appropriate level of frustration, but just ends up making him laugh. The Knights discuss meetups, the journey to Death Ray Comics, and thank people multiple times. The flick pick is Ever After: A Cinderella Story because Ceebs wanted a girly movie and chose the best Cinderella movie she's ever seen!
