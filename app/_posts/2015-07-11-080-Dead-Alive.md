In this week's dose of verbal diarrhea, the Knights sell out after an odd turn of events leads to a listener tossing some green backs their way. As a reward for his patronage, [Tom Sherlock](https://twitter.com/judgefunkyboy) chose the Flick Pick, [Dead Alive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103873/). Both Knights are now reconsidering their position as sell outs. In all seriousness, the amount of support we get from you guys is awesome. We love you guys, and thank you for playing along with us on these silly adventures. The Knights totally have cases of the feels tonight, and as always that's toKnight with a 'K'!
