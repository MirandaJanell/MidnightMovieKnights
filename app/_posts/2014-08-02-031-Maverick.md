abstract:	"The Knights try something new, the Tournament of the Segments! We introduced a spinning wheel for picking topics and we added a bit of a competition. We ended up spinning 7 times and Ceebs had content for all 7 topics and Kitteh had 4. This weeks Flick Pick is Maverick and we were suddenly joined by Revelstoke Jim when he called out Kitteh for all his talk about savages. We have a happy ending though, it turns out that Kitteh was revealing his own personal heritage and that he is proud to call himself savage."

The Knights try something new, the Tournament of the Segments! We introduced a spinning wheel for picking topics and we added a bit of a competition. We ended up spinning 7 times and Ceebs had content for all 7 topics and Kitteh had 4. This weeks Flick Pick is [Maverick](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110478/) and we were suddenly joined by [Revelstoke Jim](https://twitter.com/RevJimCanCon) when he called out Kitteh for all his talk about savages. We have a happy ending though, it turns out that Kitteh was revealing his own personal heritage and that he is proud to call himself savage.

#### Who News? Who Cares? (We, He, She) Cares!
- Ceebs: Doctor Who Season 8 Premeire will be in theaters across the US. I think that's really awesome but I don't know if I would enjoy that viewing experience. I'm assuming we'll both watch it at the same time and text each other the entire time. I couldn't do that in the theater, it would be rude.
